# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple yet powerful Python script performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with style and a touch of humor. 😎

## Features ✨

- ➕ **Addition**: Adds two numbers together.
- ➖ **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- ✖️ **Multiplication**: Multiplies the two numbers.
- ➗ **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero!).
- 💾 **Decimal Support**: Uses `float()` to handle both whole numbers and decimals.

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Run the script** in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. **Enter the first number** when prompted.
3. **Enter the second number** when prompted.
4. **View the results** of all four operations displayed in a fun and readable format.

## Example Output 📊

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Important Notes ⚠️

- 🚫 **Division by Zero**: The script does not handle division by zero gracefully (yet!). Entering `0` as the second number will cause an error. Future updates may include error handling for this case.
- 🔢 **Input Validation**: The script assumes you'll enter valid numbers. Non-numeric inputs will raise an error.

## Future Enhancements 🔮

- 🛡️ **Error Handling**: Add checks for invalid inputs and division by zero.
- 🔄 **More Operations**: Include exponentiation, modulus, and other fun math operations.
- 🎨 **GUI Version**: Turn this into a graphical calculator for extra flair!
